This is a note to self, or anyone willing to help.

See if you can do this:

Whenever a unit with race=khthon is within 10 HP of dying, it can (or
automatically will) explode and infect an adjacent unit.  Change the base
image so it is either bright green, or pulses bright green, when it is in
this state.

Questions:
 - This can be done with [event]s, but can it be done in race?  Or does it have
to be unit_type?

 - Is there a way to make this known to the AI?  With LUA (which I know
   nothing about...)?
